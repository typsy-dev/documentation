# API
Typsy provides an API for basic operations on Members (the users within your Account).

## Actions
The supported actions are:
1. Create a member (assign a license to a new user)
2. Depart a member (removes the assigned license and prevents login)
3. Update a member's claims (update the claims attached to a member)

## Authentication
Typsy will provide you with the following items:
1. Typsy Key: A unique key used to generate a hash.  The key is in the following format: 4de6bcec-9ebe-4ba0-8040-48ce64949d31
2. Typsy Account ID: A unique numeric ID that identifies your account. E.g. 213

Each request to the API requires a selection of Header values for authentication.

1. Typsy-Key: <INSERT HMACSHA256 HASH OF TYPSY KEY AND TIMESTAMP>
2. Typsy-Timestamp: <INSERT UTC TIMESTAMP>
3. Typsy-Account-Id: <INSERT TYPSY ACCOUNT ID>

### Generating the HMAC SHA256 Hash
#### Typsy-Key
The value for the Typsy-Key header value is a Hash of your Typsy Key and a UTC timestamp.  

The value is created by concatenating your **Typsy Key** with the **UTC timestamp**. The hash must be generated for each request as it contains a timestamp.

If your Typsy Key is **4de6bcec-9ebe-4ba0-8040-48ce64949d31** and the UTC timestamp is **2018-11-14T11:19:03.7269943Z** then you concatenate as follows:

	{KEY}:{TIMESTAMP}

	4de6bcec-9ebe-4ba0-8040-48ce64949d31:2018-11-14T11:19:03.7269943Z

This value is then hashed with your Typsy Key to generate your HMAC-SHA-256-SECRET.

The secret generated by the above example is: 
	
	aa46f939cdb152633ed01f4a4b9b5f127430f277f40c72671a68419a4d16618b

This can be demonstrated/tested using the following tool: http://beautifytools.com/hmac-generator.php
1. Where it says 'Enter message here' place: 4de6bcec-9ebe-4ba0-8040-48ce64949d31:2018-11-14T11:19:03.7269943Z
2. Where it says 'Secret key' place: 4de6bcec-9ebe-4ba0-8040-48ce64949d31
3. Select alogorithim: sha256
